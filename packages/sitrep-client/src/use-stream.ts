/**
 * Reactively reads the latest value for `topic` — raw OR derived — from the
 * `TimelineStore` supplied (indirectly, via `TelemetryProvider`'s auto-built
 * default) by the nearest `TelemetryProvider`.
 *
 * M2 bridge task: this used to read `client.getValue(topic)` directly, which
 * only ever saw raw `stream-data` frames whose `topic` matched literally —
 * permanently `undefined` for a derived topic like `vessel.state.altitudeAsl`,
 * since no server channel ever sends that literal topic string. Routing
 * through `store.sample(topic, store.currentFrame())` instead resolves BOTH
 * kinds transparently (`TimelineStore.sample`'s whole point, per its own doc:
 * "callers never need to know whether a topic is raw or derived").
 *
 * `subscribe` does two things, both required for a DERIVED topic to ever
 * actually receive data:
 * - **Derived-input ref-counting** (`store.resolveSubscriptionTopics`):
 *   subscribes every RAW input topic `topic` transitively depends on (itself,
 *   for an ordinary raw topic) via `client.subscribe` — ref-counted exactly
 *   like before, just redirected to the topics the server actually
 *   understands instead of the derived topic name.
 * - **Frame-driven reactivity** (`store.subscribeFrame`): re-renders on every
 *   frame the provider mints (`TelemetryProvider` calls `beginFrame()` on
 *   every ingest tick), not on a raw per-topic callback — the same
 *   `useTimelineStream` pattern this hook now shares, since a derived value
 *   can change from an ingest on any of several input topics, not one fixed
 *   topic name.
 *
 * `getSnapshot` reads `store.sample(topic, store.currentFrame())`, which
 * returns the same memoized `TimelinePoint` object within a frame — so
 * `useSyncExternalStore` correctly bails out of re-rendering when nothing
 * relevant to `topic` actually changed.
