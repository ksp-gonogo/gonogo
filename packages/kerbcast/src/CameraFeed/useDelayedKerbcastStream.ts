/**
 * gonogo's stream source for the shared `CameraFeed`, injected via its
 * `useStream` seam (kerbcam SDK §3.4). It composes three already-tested
 * pieces without moving any of them into the SDK:
 *
 *   1. the SDK/data-source glue `useKerbcastStream` — the raw live `MediaStream`
 *      for the RESOLVED flightId (auto-latch / fallback already applied by the
 *      feed, so this hook never re-derives it);
 *   2. gonogo's `DelayedPlayoutBuffer` (via `useDelayedPlayout`);
 *   3. the ONE shared `ViewClock` telemetry reads (`useViewClockOptional`),
 *      plus the kerbcast mission-time capture clock (`useKerbcastClock`, SDK
 *      1.4.0) that tells us WHEN each frame was captured.
 *
 * Single-authority guarantee: `view` is the same `ViewClock` instance every
 * delay-consistent telemetry surface reads, and the buffer only releases a
 * frame once that clock's `confirmedEdgeUt()` sweeps past the frame's capture
 * UT — so a media frame and a telemetry sample stamped the same UT surface on
 * the same clock crossing.
 *
 * Passthrough (byte-for-byte live, unchanged) in two cases, both by feeding
 * `useDelayedPlayout` no delay config:
 *   - no `TelemetryProvider` in the tree (`view === undefined`) — the LAN case;
 *   - no capture clock yet (`captureUt == null` — old kerbcast plugin/sidecar,
 *     or before the first ~1Hz sample), so we never hold video without knowing
 *     when it was captured.
 *
 * When both are present, each arriving frame is stamped with the live capture
 * UT (the ~1Hz sample interpolated forward by warp rate) and released against
 * `confirmedEdgeUt()`. A `resetEpoch` bump (revert / quickload / scene reload)
 * flushes the buffer so it resyncs rather than waiting on a UT that will never
 * arrive.
 *
 * MUST be a stable module-scope reference (never redefined per render) and
 * passed consistently to `CameraFeed`, per the `useStream` rules-of-hooks
 * contract.
