/**
 * The encoded-domain per-frame video delay backend (encoded-transform
 * cross-browser video-delay work, 2026-07-16 — see
 * `local_docs/reports/encoded-transform-spike-report.md` for the spike and
 * `local_docs/reports/encoded-video-delay-report.md` for the Phase-1
 * capture-UT mapping validation this backend implements).
 *
 * UNLIKE `frameDelay.ts`'s decoded backend (`MediaStreamTrackProcessor` /
 * `MediaStreamTrackGenerator` — Chromium-only on the main thread), this
 * backend attaches to the standard, cross-browser
 * `RTCRtpScriptTransform`/`RTCTransformEvent.transformer` shape: a
 * `{readable, writable}` pair of ENCODED `RTCEncodedVideoFrame`s, delivered
 * pre-decode. Empirically confirmed to hold a real multi-second delay with
 * zero drops on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (spike report), gated on a
 * REAL `confirmedEdgeUt()` computation rather than arrival+fixedDelayMs
 * (Phase-1 report) — this module is the production wiring of that proof.
 *
 * `attachEncodedFrameDelayTransform` is a thin adapter: it reuses
 * `runFrameDelayPipeline` VERBATIM (F1 from the design doc — "a new backend
 * is a new source/sink pair, not a new engine") with three encoded-specific
 * defaults `frameDelay.ts`'s decoded backend doesn't need:
 *
 *  - `isKeyframe: (f) => f.type === "key"` — real classification, not the
 *    decoded backend's hardcoded `false` (irrelevant there — a decoded
 *    frame has no GOP dependency).
 *  - `frameBytes: (f) => f.data.byteLength` — real payload size, not the
 *    decoded backend's frame-count-as-1 cap.
 *  - `gopSafeEviction: true` — MANDATORY here (see
 *    `DelayedPlayoutBuffer.gopSafeEviction`'s doc): an encoded delta frame
 *    depends on a prior reference frame, so the decoded backend's
 *    drop-oldest-non-keyframe-one-at-a-time eviction would corrupt the
 *    decode chain.
 *
 * `close()` is never called on an encoded frame — `RTCEncodedVideoFrame`
 * holds no GPU/decoder resource (a plain data object), which is exactly why
 * `frameDelay.ts`'s `FrameLike.close` became optional.
 *
 * NOT wired into `useDelayedKerbcastStream` — see the encoded-video-delay
 * report's "what's blocked" section. Attaching `receiver.transform =
 * new RTCRtpScriptTransform(...)` needs the `RTCRtpReceiver` object, which
 * lives inside the `@ksp-gonogo/kerbcast` SDK's `BrowserKerbcastTransport`
 * (the sibling `kerbcam` repo) and is discarded there today — `onTrack`
 * only forwards the bare `MediaStreamTrack`. This module is therefore
 * correct and tested, but reachable only once that SDK exposes a receiver
 * (or an equivalent attach hook) — a cross-repo, versioned change out of
 * this task's scope. The worker-side glue (`worker/kerbcastDelayWorker.ts`'s
 * `self.onrtctransform` handler) that would consume this on the shared
 * worker is the next piece once that SDK seam exists.
