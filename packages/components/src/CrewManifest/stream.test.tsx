/**
 * The stream test-adapter proof for CrewManifest (mirrors
 * `ThermalStatus/stream.test.tsx`): genuinely running off the real
 * `TelemetryProvider`/`TelemetryClient`/`TimelineStore` pipeline via
 * `StubTransport` — no legacy `DataSource` is registered anywhere in this
 * file.
 *
 * `v.crew` and `v.crewCapacity` are mapped on the wire
 * alongside the already-mapped `v.crewCount` — all three now land on the
 * single `vessel.crew` wire channel (`count` / `capacity` / `crew:
 * CrewMember[]`):
 * - MAPPED: `v.crewCount` -> `vessel.crew.count`, `v.crew` ->
 *   `vessel.crew.crew`, `v.crewCapacity` -> `vessel.crew.capacity`.
 * - GAPPED: `v.isEVA` (derived quantity with no named field on any
 *   channel yet).
 *
 * With no legacy source registered, the full roster + capacity now render
 * off the stream alone — only the EVA badge stays legacy-gapped, proving
 * the mapped fields genuinely drive the widget's rendering off the real
 * pipeline.
