// Type-level tests for the typed Topic registry.
//
// These are enforced by `tsc` (the package `typecheck` script runs them via
// `tsconfig.test-d.json`), NOT by the vitest runner — vitest 4's `expectTypeOf`
// surfacing is unreliable in this workspace (it reports "no errors" even for a
// blatant type mismatch), so the type guarantees are gated by a direct compiler pass
// instead. The runtime behaviour + C#-sync guarantees live in `topics.test.ts`.
//
// Any regression here is a compile error: a known Topic that stops resolving to its
// payload fails an `Expect<Equal<…>>`; a widened union that starts accepting unknown
// Topic strings turns an `@ts-expect-error` into an unused-directive error.
