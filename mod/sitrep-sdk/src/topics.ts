// Typed Topic registry — Uplink architecture spec §3.1.
//
// Exports a `TopicId` string-literal union of every Topic the mod declares, plus a
// `TopicPayload<T extends TopicId>` mapped type resolving each Topic to its wire
// payload interface (e.g. `TopicPayload<'vessel.orbit'>` = `VesselOrbit`). Every place
// that names a Topic — widget `channels`/`optionalChannels` declarations and the
// `useTelemetry` read hook — is constrained to this union and shares the same token,
// so there are no open string keys and no drift.
//
// ── Single source of truth (CODEGEN) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The bulk of this registry — `GeneratedTopicPayloadMap` and `GENERATED_TOPIC_IDS` in
// `./__generated__/topic-map.ts` — is GENERATED from `Sitrep.Contract`: every wire
// payload type is tagged `[SitrepTopic("<topic>")]`, and `mod/codegen.sh` (via
// `RtConfig.EmitTopicMap`) reflects over those tags to emit both the payload interfaces
// (`contract.ts`) and the Topic→payload map (`topic-map.ts`). A Topic added or removed
// in C# therefore flows through codegen into this file with no hand edit; `topics.test.ts`
// additionally re-reads the C# `const string …Topic` declarations and asserts `TOPIC_IDS`
// stays in exact sync.
//
// ── The hand-declared tail (NOT codegen-derived) ────────────────────────────────────
// Two Topics have no `Sitrep.Contract` payload TYPE to reflect, so they are declared by
// hand below rather than generated — deliberately, because a fabricated contract type
// would misrepresent the wire (the CRITICAL "mirror the exact serialized shape" rule):
//   • `scansat.available` is a bare JSON boolean (the uplink publishes `true`/`false`
//     directly — see GonogoScansatUplink/ScansatUplink.cs), not an object, so there is
//     no named payload type; it resolves to `boolean`.
//   • `system.uplinks` is the engine-aggregated Uplink roster/health channel, declared
//     by `ChannelEngine` itself and built as a dictionary in `BuildSystemUplinksPayload`
//     (no `[SitrepTopic]` type), so its structured shape is hand-mirrored here.
// (`scansat.scanningVessels` was previously in this tail as `unknown[]` while its element
// shape was deferred; it now carries the wire-typed `ScanningVesselEntry` contract and is
// codegen-derived like every other array Topic.)
// It does not resolve to `unknown` — the registry has no `unknown` Topics (proven at
// compile time by `_AssertNoTopicResolvesToUnknown` below).
